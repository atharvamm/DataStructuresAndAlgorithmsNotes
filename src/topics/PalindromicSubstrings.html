<h2 id="approach">Approach</h2>

<p>Question that might be worth confirming if asked in an interview would be :  Are duplicates allowed ? </p>
<p>To find palindromes the best way would be to go at each index and find palidromes around that index. At each index there are two ways to do that: 1. Either a palindrome with odd length where the current index is the center or 2. A palindrome with even length where the current index and neighbour index are the center.</p>
<p>Note: Try to remember this pattern, it is especially useful for questions on palindromes.</p>

    <li>The most important point to remember here is that for palindromes you have two types. One where the palindrome starts from the same element which are odd length palindromes. On the other hand if the palindrome starts from consecutive elements in that case we have even length palindromes.</li>
