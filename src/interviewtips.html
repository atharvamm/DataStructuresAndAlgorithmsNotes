        <ul>
          <li>We want to drive the interview, so even if we know the solution, do not directly give it away. Rather build up to it.
            <ul>
              <li>Ask test cases and give the brute force soln.</li>
              <li>Try to get better solution and then finally get the optimal solution.(Remember the time you got fucked in Amazon interview cause the problem was easy and you only figured out the optimal solution asap, and then they you were asked 2 other hard problems to cover remaining time.)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>Extra</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Think about edge cases while solving problems, and then talk about them during interviews.</li>
